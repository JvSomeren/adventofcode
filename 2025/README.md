# Advent of Code 2025

Before running the solver for a specific day ensure that the related input is located in the [`src/inputs/`](src/inputs/) directory. The expected naming scheme is `dayXX.txt` where `XX` is the number of the day.

Then simply use `zig run src/dayXX.zig` to solve for day `XX`.

Tests can be run using `zig test src/dayXX.zig`.
